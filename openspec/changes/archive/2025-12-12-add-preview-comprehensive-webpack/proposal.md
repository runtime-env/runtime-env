# Change: Add preview feature for comprehensive-webpack example

## Why

The comprehensive-vite example includes a preview feature allowing contributors to preview builds locally; comprehensive-webpack lacks the same UX leading to inconsistency and extra setup for contributors.

## What Changes

- Add a preview command and documentation to the comprehensive-webpack example that mirrors the comprehensive-vite preview behavior.
- Provide a sample script, minimal configuration, and a short how-to in the example's README.

## Impact

- Affects examples: comprehensive-webpack
- Affects developer UX only; no production code changes
