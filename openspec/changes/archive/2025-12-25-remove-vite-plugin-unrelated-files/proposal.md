# Change: Remove Unrelated Generated Files from Vite Plugin

## Why

Users have reported that the `@runtime-env/vite-plugin` sometimes generates unrelated files or directories (like `./.vite-runtime-env`) in their project. These artifacts clutter the project and can be confusing.

## What Changes

- **Refactor**: Move common CLI invocation logic to `utils.ts` and ensure robust CLI resolution.
- **Cleanup**: Use `node_modules/.runtime-env` for all temporary files generated by the plugin to avoid cluttering the project root.
- **Robustness**: Ensure temporary files are cleaned up reliably using `try...finally` blocks where appropriate.
- **Spec Update**: Update the `vite-plugin` spec to reflect the use of `utils.ts` for shared logic, correcting the "no shared utils" requirement which is currently violated and leads to duplication.

## Impact

- Affected specs: `vite-plugin`
- Affected code: `packages/vite-plugin/src/*.ts`
