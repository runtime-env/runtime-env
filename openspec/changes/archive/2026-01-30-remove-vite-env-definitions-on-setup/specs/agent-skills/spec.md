## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Runtime Env Vite Plugin Skill

The system SHALL provide a skill to guide agents on `runtime-env` usage with Vite, following a concise "composition patterns" structure where each rule is defined in its own file and reflected in the specification.

#### Scenario: Rule - Setup runtime-env plugin

- **WHEN** setting up a Vite project with `@runtime-env/vite-plugin`
- **THEN** the plugin MUST be installed using the project's package manager
- **AND** the `runtimeEnv()` plugin MUST be used in vite configuration as a default import
- **AND** the `<script src="/runtime-env.js"></script>` tag MUST be included in `index.html`, before the main application script entry point
- **AND** a `.runtimeenvschema.json` file MUST be created at the project root, listing all public environment variables with appropriate types in JSON-schema format
- **AND** any existing Vite-specific environment variable type definitions (typically found in `src/vite-env.d.ts` as `interface ImportMetaEnv` or `interface ImportMeta`) MUST be removed to prevent conflicts and ensure a single source of truth via `runtimeEnv`
- **AND** the setup MUST perform a migration from old code by instructing agents to use the other two rules (`Use runtime public env in JavaScript/TypeScript` and `Use runtime public env in index.html`) to replace static environment variable usage with runtime ones
