# Changes to environment variables is not updated

You will need to restart your dev server after changing the environment variables.

This is useful, for example:

- You want to track bugs for production, but you don't want to shut down the development environment.
- Or, you want to start multiple development environments at the same time and each one has its own environment variables.
